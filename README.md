## Why

Have you ever tried to create a layout but it don't look the same? You have a design to guide you and great tools to inspect elements, you know CSS but it's looks different yet. Perhaps is because you're worried about the implementation, sprint's deadline, integration with backend services or just because you need to switch your eyes between screens and browsers tabs over and over again. It's too much to care about it and create the perfect UI.

PerfectUI was made to help you to create the perfect screen/component UI, looking the differences between your screen and the design while you're coding and your application is reloaded.

You just need to upload an image file of your layout page or component UI and than control its opacity, scale and position dragging it over the screen.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev react-perfectui
```

or

```bash
yarn add --dev react-perfectui
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import PerfectUI from 'react-perfectui'

function YourPage(props) {
  return(
    //...
  )
}

export default PerfectUI(YourPage)
```

## Limitations

### Z-Index and mouse interactions.

The uploaded image is used as background with a z-index property in a layer over your page. Nevertheless, the mouse's events, such as hover, click, focus on some elements, might doesn't works properly. Condering this, you should use PerfectUI just to build and compare your design UI and not in the logic and process moment.

### Localstorage limit.

PerfectUI uses the localstorage to store your image, parsed into Base64, and the previous settings. By default, the size limit in Localstorage's browsers is 10MB. If the cota is exceeded, an warning is showed in console and will not save/update the data in localstorage. In this case, you'll need to compress, decrease the size or quality of your image file. You can use online services like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) or [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) to do this.
